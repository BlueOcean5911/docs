There are two kinds of tasks: **Manually Created Tasks** and **Auto Created Tasks** based on cadence steps.

## Manually Created Task

You can create a task manually by clicking on the Create Task button located in the top right corner of the page. Additionally, your Sales Manager can also create a task for you using the same button and assign it directly to you.

#### Steps to Create a Manually Created Task:

1. Click on the Create Task button.
2. Fill in the required details such as title, lead, type, priority, and due date.
3. Add any relevant notes for context.
4. Click Save to create the task.

## Auto Created Task

Auto Created Tasks are generated automatically based on predefined cadence steps. These tasks are integral to maintaining a structured workflow.

#### How Auto Created Tasks Work:

Tasks are created automatically as you progress through the cadence steps.
Upon completion of a task, the cadence will move to the next step.
If a task is not completed, the cadence will pause, preventing progression until the task is finished.

#### Benefits of Auto Created Tasks:

Ensures that you follow a structured approach to your work.
Helps in maintaining a consistent workflow without manual intervention.
