# Inbound Call Instructions

Receiving inbound calls from customers is an integral part of our service. This guide outlines the process of handling incoming calls efficiently.

## Receiving an Inbound Call

When a customer calls you, you will receive a notification indicating an incoming call. This notification is crucial for ensuring that you can respond promptly to customer inquiries.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Notification of Incoming Call**

   - When a customer is trying to reach you, a notification will appear on your screen. This notification will typically include the caller's information, allowing you to prepare for the conversation.

2. **Review Caller Information**

   - At the bottom of the screen, you will find detailed information about the incoming call. This may include the customer's name, contact number, and any relevant notes from previous interactions.

3. **Accepting the Call**

   - If you wish to speak with the customer, click the **Accept** button. This action will connect you to the caller, allowing you to start the conversation.
