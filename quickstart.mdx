To get started with AIVIO, an organizer or admin (such as a CEO or Sales Marketing Manager) can initiate the process by requesting a demo and creating an organization.

Once the request is submitted, the AIVIO marketing team will review the details and reach out to discuss the plan that best suits your needs. After the discussion, the AIVIO management team will activate your organization, granting you access to our application.

This streamlined process ensures that you receive personalized support and guidance as you embark on your journey with AIVIO.
