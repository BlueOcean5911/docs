## Automated Email by Cadence

Automated emails are generated by the cadence steps after adding a lead into a specific cadence. This allows for consistent follow-up without manual intervention.

- **Delete Email and Finish Cadence**: Remove the email from the cadence and mark the cadence as complete.

- **Reply to Thread After Delivering**: Respond to the email thread after the email has been delivered to maintain the conversation.

- **Mark as Interested**: Indicate that the recipient has shown interest, allowing for targeted follow-up.
