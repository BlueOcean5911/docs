## Additional Actions for Tasks in Cadence

When working with tasks in a cadence, you have additional options to manage your tasks efficiently:

### Complete the Task in Cadence

- When you mark a task as complete, the cadence will automatically move to the next task. This streamlines your workflow and ensures that you stay on track with your cadence objectives.

### Skip the Task in Cadence

- If you choose to skip a task, the cadence will also automatically proceed to the next task. This option is useful when you encounter a task that cannot be completed for any reason, allowing you to maintain momentum in your workflow without manual intervention.

By following these steps and utilizing the available options, you can effectively manage your tasks, ensuring a productive and organized approach to your work.
