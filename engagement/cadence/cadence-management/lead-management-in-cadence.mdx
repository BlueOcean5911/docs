Managing leads effectively is essential for any sales or marketing strategy. In this section, you can monitor the status of each lead within the **Cadence** framework, providing a clear view of where each lead stands in the engagement process.

- **Paused**: Engagement with the lead is temporarily halted.
- **Finished**: The engagement process for this lead has been completed.
- **Other States**: Additional states such as "Removed" or "Bounced" can also be tracked.
