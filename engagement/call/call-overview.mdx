# Phone Call Feature in Our App

Our app provides a robust phone call feature that allows sales representatives to communicate directly with customers. This functionality not only facilitates seamless interactions but also enables representatives to analyze their activities and improve their skills through detailed call history and analytics.

## Key Features

The app maintains a comprehensive history of all calls made, allowing sales representatives to review their interactions with customers. This feature is crucial for analyzing performance and identifying areas for improvement.

### 3. Call Recording

- **Recording Calls:** The app allows for call recording, which can be beneficial for training and quality assurance purposes.
- **Legal Considerations:** Recording calls may have legal implications. Therefore, users must enable the recording feature before initiating a call. It is essential to comply with local laws and regulations regarding call recording.

### 4. Call Analytics

The app provides analytics on call history, enabling sales representatives to track metrics such as:

- Duration of calls
