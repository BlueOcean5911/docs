## Overview

Lead tracking is a fundamental component of effective sales and marketing strategies. In the **Cadence** framework, you can monitor the status and engagement levels of your leads, enabling you to make informed decisions and optimize your outreach efforts.

### 1. Lead Status Tracking

In the table of leads within Cadence, you can easily track the status of each lead. This feature provides a clear overview of where each lead stands in the engagement process, allowing you to:

- **Monitor Progress**: Keep an eye on how leads move through different stages of the cadence, from initial contact to final follow-up.
- **Identify Bottlenecks**: Quickly identify leads that may require additional attention or follow-ups due to inactivity or lack of response.
- **Organize Outreach**: Based on the lead status, you can prioritize your outreach efforts, ensuring that you focus on leads that are most likely to convert.

### 2. Lead Analytics in Cadence

Analyzing lead data is crucial for understanding the effectiveness of your engagement strategies. The analytics dashboard provides insights into various lead statuses, including:

- **Total**: The total number of leads currently in the cadence, giving you a comprehensive view of your outreach efforts.
- **Cold**: Leads that have not engaged with your communications for a significant period. Identifying cold leads allows you to strategize re-engagement efforts.
- **Approaching**: Leads that are nearing a follow-up deadline. This status helps you prioritize timely actions to avoid losing potential opportunities.
- **Replied**: Leads that have responded to your outreach. Tracking replies helps gauge interest and effectiveness of your messaging.
- **Interested**: Leads that have shown a clear interest in your offerings. These leads should be prioritized for personalized follow-ups.
- **Not Interested**: Leads that have explicitly indicated they are not interested. This status helps in refining your target audience and reducing unnecessary follow-ups.
- **Unresponsive**: Leads that have not engaged despite multiple outreach attempts. Understanding this status can help you adjust your approach or remove them from active campaigns.
- **Do Not Contact**: Leads that should be excluded from future outreach for various reasons, such as previous requests to opt out.
- **Bad Data**: Leads with inaccurate or incomplete information. Maintaining a clean database is essential for effective communication.
- **Changed Job**: Leads that have updated their employment status. Keeping track of these changes ensures that your outreach remains relevant and targeted.
