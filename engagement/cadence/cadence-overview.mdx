# Cadence: Streamlined Outreach Campaigns

**Overview**

Cadence refers to a structured approach for sales teams to engage with prospects through a series of planned interactions over time. Similar to sequences, cadences are designed to facilitate meaningful conversations and convert leads into customers efficiently.

**Purpose**

Cadences help sales professionals maintain a consistent outreach strategy, ensuring that each touchpoint—whether it’s a phone call, email, or social media interaction—builds upon the previous one. By creating a rhythm in your outreach efforts, you enhance your chances of connecting with potential customers and guiding them through the sales pipeline.

**Key Features**

- **Multi-Channel Engagement**: Utilize various touchpoints, including personalized emails, calls, and social media interactions, to keep prospects engaged.
- **Customizable Steps**: Tailor each step of your cadence to suit your target audience, ensuring that your messaging resonates with their specific needs and interests.

- **Automated and Manual Touchpoints**: Balance automated messages with personalized interactions to create a comprehensive outreach strategy.

- **Tracking and Analytics**: Monitor the effectiveness of your cadences through metrics and analytics, allowing you to refine your approach continuously.
